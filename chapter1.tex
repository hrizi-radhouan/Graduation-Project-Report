	\section{Project Presentation}
	
	\subsection{Context}
	As part of its software development and consulting activities, oriented towards the business of Marketing Mix Modelling (MMM), Mass-Analytics is always looking to offer its customers products that are the most efficient and smart. Thus, It seeking to provide innovative services that satisfied the different needs of customers based on new technologies.
	\\
	\\
	In this context, this project entitled \textbf{MassTer Insight SaaS} was offered to me by Mass-Analytics as part of a graduation project to obtain the national diploma of computer engineer.      
	\subsection{Objectives}
	The main objective of this project is to develop MassTer Insight from the exiting Desktop solution to a SaaS.
	\\
	\\
	We are in charge to keep the same business logic of the desktop solution, but offered to the customers in cloud SaaS version with Security guaranteed,  high perform in term of Speed, Visualization, Graphics, Design .
	\subsection{Problematic}
	Today all the companies move to cloud, they are tend to by their softwares through cloud SaaS, for more reasons : one amongst the reason is security, when you offer an executable software, this one is threaten by the crack, also an executable requires sometimes to take care of your resources needs, an important RAM, CPU, and more. Almost the executable save data locally which is a very bad way to stock data, it is possible to loose these data once the hard disk is defect by an external effect or even internal. we don't need to inform the customer for each updates to keep installing our software, once he/she connect on the web application he/she got the last version without any process of installation.  
	\\
	\\
	That's what we care about, our current solution Masster Insight desktop is threaten by the crack, may will be heavy on machine with smaller resources, works only on pc. it requires the process of installation wasted time.

	\section{Methodology}
	The choice of the methodology is an important step in software development since it grants formalizing the preliminary steps when establishing a system in pursuance of the client’s requirements.
	The scrum , an approach that is part of the Agile movement, was used when carrying out this project.
	
	\section{Software Development Life Cycle}
	We chosen the \textbf{Iterative Model }as Software Development Life cycle (SDLC) presented in Fig \ref{sdlc_iterative}.
	\\
	\\
	This model turns the process of development in cyclic manner repeating very step after every cycle of SDLC process.

	\end{figure}  

	\section{Software Development Process}
	Test-driven development (TDD) shown in Fig \ref{TDD_Global_Lifecycle} is a techniques of implementation code, starts with developing test for each features. 
	\\
	\\
	The developer writes a little test code and then implements the business, in the traditional method, the test comes from the code, but in TDD the business code is submissive to tests then it is corrected until the tests are validated.
