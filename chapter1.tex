	\section{Life cycle}
	\section{Methodology}
	The choice of the methodology is an important step in software development since it grants formalizing the preliminary steps when establishing a system in pursuance of the client’s requirements.
	The  ? scrum ? TDD, an approach that is part of the Agile movement, was used when carrying out this project.
		\section{Existing Presentation}
	\textbf{MassTer Insight Desktop Application} is an easy to use software that allows you to run simulation scenarios and allocate your budget optimally across Regions, Products, Channels and Periods. It tells you how much budget to spend on every single media channel and in which period, given a complex modelling structure. It will helps you to benefit from your Marketing Mix Modelling projects [1]. 
	\section{Critics}
	Today all the company move to cloud, they are tend to by their softwares through cloud SaaS, for more reasons : one amongst the reason is the security, when you offer an excutable software, this one is threaten by the crack, also an excutable requieres sometimes to take care of your resources needs, an important RAM, CPU, and more. Almost the Exutable save data locally which is a very bad way to stock data, it is possible to loose these data once the hard disk is defect by an external effect or even internal.
	\\
	\\
	That's what we care about, our current solution Masster Insight desktop is threateen by the crack, may will be heavy on machine with smaller resources, works only on pc. it requires the process of installation wasted time.
